aquametBio
==========

Description
-----------

The goal of aquametBio is to calculate metrics and multimetric indices
for fish and macroinvertebrates, as used in the National Rivers and
Streams Assessment (NRSA) for 2008-9 and 2013-14 and the National Lakes
Assessment (NLA) for 2007 and 2012. This package is built from the
aquamet package v. 2.5.1, utilizing only the functions based on
biological data. The package includes default taxalists for fish in
NRSA, macroinvertebrates in NRSA, and macroinvertebrates in NLA.
